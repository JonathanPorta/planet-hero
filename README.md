Planet Hero is my second Unity3D game, well, second game ever. Your goal is to jump from planet to planet while fighting off an onslaught of rectangle with frickin' laser beams. 

Controls: 
- A, D or Left, Right arrow keys to orbit the current planet. 
- Left click on another planet to jump to it. 
- Right click to spawn enemies - mash it for best results. 
- Shoot your frickin' laser beam with Spacebar. 
- Zoom the viewport in and out with the scroll wheel on your mouse.
